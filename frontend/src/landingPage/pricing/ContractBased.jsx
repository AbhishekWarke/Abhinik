          AbhiNik Elevators also offers comprehensive contract-based services, primarily through Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC), 
          with an option for half-yearly contracts as per the customer's preference. These contracts are designed to provide long-term, 
          reliable service, ensuring that your elevators run smoothly year-round, minimizing unexpected breakdowns and reducing long-term 
          maintenance costs.

        <p className="mt-4" style={{ fontSize: "1.2rem", fontWeight: "300" }}>
          The price of the AMC contract depends on various factors, including the type of elevator and its specifications. To maintain 
          transparency, we conduct a thorough routine inspection of the elevator prior to finalizing the contract. This check ensures that 
          there is no pre-existing damage or wear that could affect the performance and safety of your lift system. It also helps us better 
          understand the specific needs of your elevator, so we can provide the most appropriate and cost-effective maintenance solutions.

        <p className="mt-4" style={{ fontSize: "1.2rem", fontWeight: "300" }}>
